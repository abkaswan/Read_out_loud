Success! The model is running, and we're seeing logs from preprocess and postprocess. The key is this line: Found 0 bubbles above 
  threshold 0.5. This is expected because we're feeding it a blank, dummy image.

  The next step is to understand the exact structure of the output tensors so we can correctly parse them. The console is currently
  collapsing them into Je objects.

  I'll add more detailed logging to the postprocess method in onnx-bubble-detector.js to print the dimensions (dims) and a small sample of
  the data from the output tensors. This will give us the final piece of the puzzle.
